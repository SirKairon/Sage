## About The Project
Sage is a game made with Java in Greenfoot Launcher. This project started off as an assignment but evolved into a months-long personal project with various levels.
It is a levels-based game to get Sage back to his home world. Sage has been stranded on unknown dimensions. To get back home, he needs to pass through hostile worlds through Portals accessed only by special Keys. But getting the Key for each dimension is not an easy task, because they are guarded by Dragons! 
Help Sage to get home by collecting the Anti-Gravity and Speed Power-Ups, but beware, dragons can get fast too!
