# Sage
Sage - Greenfoot Game based on Java

Sage has been stranded on unknown dimensions. To get back home, he needs to pass through hostile worlds through Portals accessed only by special Keys. But getting the Key for each dimension is not an easy task, because they are guarded by Dragons! 

Help Sage to get home by collecting the Anti-Gravity and Speed Power-Ups, but beware, dragons can get fast too!

## About The Project
Shifting to another country from your homeland and entering
a multi-cultured society could be difficult. Even the founders and the team mates had faced a similar struggle 
and were not able to easily find resources to adjust to this new and wonderful part of their journey. This led us
creating UniMates, an all-in-one website which guides the international students to easily adjust to this new 
lifetsyle. 
Use the main.html to get started.
